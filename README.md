# A Certified String Solver

CertiStr is a certified string solver developed by [Isabelle proof assistant](https://isabelle.in.tum.de/) and [OCaml](https://ocaml.org/).

## Isabelle Code

All the formalizations and proofs can be found [isabelle_code](isabelle_code).
The proofs related to Symblic Finite Transducers (SFT) have been upgraded to [Isabelle 2024](https://isabelle.in.tum.de/)
There are still some other proofs have not been upgraded.

To run the proofs of SFTs, open the file `isabelle_code/Automata/implementation/RBT_CodeExport.thy`


## Compile CertiStr

CertiStr's front-end (not certified) is developed base on (1) [dolmen](https://github.com/Gbury/dolmen) and (2)
[ocaml-re-nfa](https://github.com/ShlKan/ocaml-re-nfa).
Note that The original [ocaml-re-nfa](https://github.com/yallop/ocaml-re-nfa) does not support symbolic finiate automata.
You must install the branch in my repo.

We use `dune` to manage the projet. To build, run `dune build`. To test (cram test), run `dune runtest`.
