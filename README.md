# A Certified String Solver

CertiStr is a certified string solver developed by [Isabelle proof assistant](https://isabelle.in.tum.de/) and [OCaml](https://ocaml.org/).

## Isabelle Code

All the formalizations and proofs can be found in [isabelle_code](isabelle_code).
The proofs related to Symbolic Finite Transducers (SFT) have been upgraded to [Isabelle 2025](https://isabelle.in.tum.de/)
There are still some other proofs that have not been upgraded.

To run the proofs of SFTs, open the theory `isabelle_code/Automata/implementation/RBT_CodeExport.thy`

1. The abstract-level transducer is defined in [Transducer_new.thy](isabelle_code/Automata/Transducer_new.thy).
2. The implementation-level transducer is defined in [Transducer_Impl_new.thy](isabelle_code/Automata/implementation/Transducer_Impl_new.thy).
3. The abstract-level epsilon-SFA is defined in [NFA_epsilon.thy](isabelle_code/Automata/NFA_epsilon.thy).
4. The implementation-level epsilon-SFA is defined in [Epsilon_Elim_Imp.thy](isabelle_code/Automata/implementation/Epsilon_Elim_Imp.thy).
5. Interval is defined in [Interval.thy](isabelle_code/Automata/implementation/Interval.thy).


## Compile CertiStr

CertiStr's front-end (not certified) is developed based on (1) [dolmen](https://github.com/Gbury/dolmen) and (2)
[ocaml-re-nfa (my branch)](https://github.com/ShlKan/ocaml-re-nfa).
Note that, the original [ocaml-re-nfa](https://github.com/yallop/ocaml-re-nfa) does not support symbolic finite automata.
You must install the branch in my repo (`opam install [path to ocaml-re-nfa]`).

We use `dune` to manage the project. To build, jump into the [CertiStr](CertiStr) folder and run `dune build`. 
To test (cram test), run `dune runtest`.

The automatically generated OCaml code for SFTs from Isabelle can be found in [Generated Code](CertiStr/lib/automata/Automata_lib.ml)
