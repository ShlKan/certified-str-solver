Application: Evaluation of String Solvers on PCP
Target solver: cvc5, Z3, OSTRICH
Time limit: 60.0
Benchmarks encoding PCP[3,4] that were considered hard to solve by the paper
'Creating Difficult Instances of the Post Correspondence Problem'. Most were solved later with different
techniques like Parikh Automata and Model Checking but String Solvers have not been tested.
