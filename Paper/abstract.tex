Finite Transducers (FTs) extend the capabilities of Finite Automata (FAs) by enabling the transformation of input strings into output strings, thereby providing a more expressive framework for operations that encompass both recognition and transformation. FTs have wide applications, including program analysis, string constraint solving, and security-critical sanitizer analysis.
However, there is currently no scalable formalization of FTs. This is primarily because transition labels in FTs are not formalized symbolically, resulting in transition explosion and significant performance bottlenecks in practical applications.

In this paper, we present a formalization of FTs in the symbolic setting using Isabelle/HOL, where transition labels can be instantiated with various Boolean algebras, such as intervals and arithmetic predicates. This symbolic approach enables not only efficient FT operations—such as computing the output language of an FT given a regular language—but also supports infinite alphabets.

To evaluate the effectiveness of our formalization, we apply the formalized SFTs to two applications: (1) \texttt{HTMLdecode}, a sanitizer used for preventing XSS attacks, and (2) a string solver that models replacement operations with various semantics, including left-most and replace-all matching. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves computational efficiency in constraint-solving scenarios.
